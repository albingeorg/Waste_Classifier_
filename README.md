# Waste-Classifier

**Waste-Classifier** is a web-based application that classifies uploaded images into different types of waste. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Python for the backend image classification.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of the project is to enable users to upload images of waste items (such as plastic, paper, metal, etc.) and classify them into respective waste categories. This is helpful for better waste management, contributing to a cleaner environment.

## Features

- **Upload and Classify:** Users can upload images of waste through the web interface, and the system will classify them.
- **Real-Time Classification:** The uploaded image is processed in real-time using a Python-based classification algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and clean design with easy-to-use functionality built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions and dynamic updates on the frontend.

### Backend
- **Python:** The core of the classification logic is written in Python.
- **Flask/Django (choose one if applicable):** Python web framework used to manage backend functionality (e.g., handling file uploads, processing requests).
- **Image Classification Model:** Machine learning or deep learning-based image classifier, which could be built using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.

## Setup and Installation
